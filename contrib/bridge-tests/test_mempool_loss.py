"""A fed transaction that the node later loses must be fed again.

`mempool.dat` is written only on a clean shutdown, so a crash, an OOM kill or a container stop that
outruns the shutdown leaves the node with an empty mempool -- here simulated exactly with
-persistmempool=0. X is fed and accepted; B restarts and X is gone; the next Bitcoin block carries Y,
which spends X. The anchor has moved past X's block, so it is never re-fed: X is lost, Y then has
missing inputs and is dropped, and so is everything that later spends either. Fixed: fed
transactions are tracked until they confirm, and one that vanishes is offered again.

Usage: test_mempool_loss.py [<ecx-bitcoind>]      exit 0 = both arrived, 1 = lost
